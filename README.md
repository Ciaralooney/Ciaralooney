### How I developed an interest in coding
At the age of 10 I went to techkidz.ie summer camp. This is where I learned basic html for a website. This was my introduction to coding and where I started to become interested in it. After that I always took coding classes when I could. I attended coding classes at Dell, UCC, Colaiste Choilm and St. Aloysius. These gave me more of a basic understanding of coding languages such as python

In my TY year I was involved with the Johnson Control STEM program for the duration of the year. I was working with a group of 5 students and we worked to build a website focusing on mindfulness. We had to consider things like CSS on our site and worked together well as a team. Last summer I went to the UCC summer coding camp. Thatâ€™s where I really started to learn python, after that I continued on to the 2019 UCC MPT program. 

During the MPT program I learned so much python (such as repetitions, functions, lists, turtle graphics, files, strings and tkinter interface) Java, CSS and so much more html then I knew before. My websites went from looking like [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20200208105913/https://cs1.ucc.ie/~cl33/week1/week1.html)  to looking like [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20200229112156/https://cs1.ucc.ie/~cl33/competition/week5/) and I learned how to implement more [interactive features](https://web.archive.org/web/20200229101043/https://cs1.ucc.ie/~cl33/week4/) in websites.
 
During my 2020 midterm break I also did work experience with the Live Optics Software development team in Dell since I was interested to see what it would be like working with a software development team and I got to learn about the development process, sprints and quality checks. 

Over the 2020 summer holidays I was working with UCC developing a web scraper in a brand new language for me (golang). My learning was exponential over that first month. 

During my time with UCC I got used to problem solving and since I was completely new to go everything in my program has been a learning experience. I learned many things such as web scraping, reversing strings, trimming strings, loops, recursion, good indentation, working with xml files and writing to files such .xml and .txt and so much more. This was a great opportunity in order for me to get some development and project management experience.
