### Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ciara, Iâ€™ve always had an interest in computers and have been coding since I was 10  but only in the last year have I really started to learn more complex things in coding.  

At the age of 10 I went to techkidz.ie summer camp. This is where I learned basic html for a website. This was my introduction to coding and where I started to become interested in it.

After that I always took coding classes when I could. I attended coding classes at Dell, Colaiste Choilm and St. Aloysius. These gave me more of a basic understanding of coding languages such as python

### More recently 

In my TY year I was involved with the Johnson Control STEM program for the duration of the year. I was working with a group of 5 students and we worked to build a website focusing on mindfulness. We had to consider things like CSS on our site and worked together well as a team. Last summer I went to the UCC summer coding camp. Thatâ€™s where I really started to learn python, after that I continued on to the 2019 UCC MPT program. 

During the MPT program I learned so much python (such as repetitions, functions, lists, turtle graphics, files, strings and tkinter interface) Java, CSS and so much more html then I knew before. My websites went from looking like <a href="https://cs1.ucc.ie/~cl33/week1/week1.html" target="_blank">this</a>
 to looking like <a href="https://cs1.ucc.ie/~cl33/competition/week5/" target="_blank">this</a>
 and I learned how to implement more interactive features in websites such as <a href="https://cs1.ucc.ie/~cl33/week4/" target="_blank">this</a>
 
During my recent midterm break I also did work experience with the Live Optics Software development team since I was interested to see what it would be like working with a software development team and I got to learn about the development process and quality checks. 

### Right Now

Most recently over this summer holidays Iâ€™ve been working with ucc developing a web scraper in a brand new language for me (golang) Iâ€™ve definitely learned more than I ever know about coding. My learning has been exponential over the past month. 

Iâ€™ve really gotten used to problem solving and since I was completely new to go everything in my program has been a learning experience. I've learned many things such as web scraping, reversing strings, trimming strings, loops, recursion, good indentation, recursion, working with xml files and writing to files such .xml and .txt and so much more. 

I learned quickly in order to get as much done as I could and progress with my project. Itâ€™s hard to really say how much Iâ€™ve learned about go and coding over the past month but if you look at my program I learned everything there over the past month
